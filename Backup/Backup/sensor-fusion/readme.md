I watched Scott's videos ([video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9jXoG0QYIA&t=573s) and [video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M6wSLD-8M8&t=687s)) over and over again and learnt a lot.
His original implementation is in Golang, found [here](https://github.com/slobdell/kalman-filter-example) and a [blog post](http://scottlobdell.me/2017/01/gps-accelerometer-sensor-fusion-kalman-filter-practical-walkthrough/) covering the details.

Do I owe him a beer, now? Yes!
